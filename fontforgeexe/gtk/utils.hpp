// function is useful when the widget performs some action on activation and
// changes its apperance (e.g. toggle button). Sometimes we just want to set its
// apperance without triggereing the action.
//
// Arguments:
//  * w - GTK widget. Note that it might need to be cast to the type which
//    actually defines the signal, to avoid a conflict during template type
//    deduction.
//  * signal - the signal which should be disconnected and reconnected when
//    changing the visual state.
//  * signal_handler - the function which should be reconnected to the signal
//    after the visual state was changed. Generally, this is just the normal
//    handler for that signal.
//  * state_changer - the function which actually changes the visual state while
//    the signal is disconnected.
